            <p class="black-text", style="margin-top: 10px;">My passion for problem solving drives me as a developer, pushing me to develop my technical skills each day as I build apps. Currently looking to work for a digital agency serving software solutions to clients where I can gain exposure to various projects and developer tools. This would also be the ideal environment to leverage my past experience working within consistent deadlines.</p>
