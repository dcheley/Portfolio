            <p class="black-text", style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify;">My passion for problem solving drives me as a Software Developer to look for creative solutions and suggest alternative methods to help clients solve business issues, pushing me to continuously develop my technical skills each day as I build applications. Currently looking to work for a digital agency delivering innovative applications design and software solutions to clients where I can gain exposure to various projects and developer tools. This would be the ideal environment to leverage my past experience working with a diverse network of talented professionals to deliver on agreed upon specifications within required time frame and budgets.</p>
